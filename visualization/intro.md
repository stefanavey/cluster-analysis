After exploring the data briefly, we've learned a little about the structure and types of data included, and even begun to see a relationship between `Sepal.Length` and `Species`. We might want to know even more about the data including:

* Are there correlations between any of the quantitative variables?
* How is each measurement distributed? Is the distribution different between species?
* How do the 3 species differ? How are they alike? Are these differences significant?
* Can we accurately classify the 3 species based on sepal and petal measurements?

Data visualization ultimately aims to tell a story. As we delve deeper into our data, we will jump back and forth between exploring the data and visualizing it. By taking the time to get to know the data, our visualization improves drastically, We'll now jump into the most common visualization methods when approaching data, and move onto answering some of these questions posed above.
