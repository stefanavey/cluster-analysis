Before undertaking any analysis, we must first understand the data at hand. How we mold the data determines what kinds of questions can be asked effectively, and can lead us to gain new insights. To better understand any data set, we need to understand the difference between data types. They are as follows:

* **Categorical** : with two or more categories, there is no intrinsic ordering to these categories. gender (male and female), color (red, blue, green), hair color (blonde, brown, red, etc.) are all examples of categorical variables; there is no logical way to order these from highest to lowest. Categorical variables are *qualitative* measures.

* **Ordinal** : similar to a categorical variable, here there is a clear ordering. For example, we may have symptoms (none, mild, moderate, severe), economic status (low, medium, high). As with categorical variables, these are *qualitative* in nature.

* **Interval** : similar to an ordinal variable, except that the intervals between values are equally spaced. For example, if we measure income in dollars, the difference between $15 and $10 and $20 and $15 are the same ($5). An interval variable typically represents a *quantitative* (numerical) metric.
