## About this Project
This project emerged from longstanding conversations between Stefan and Robert as they served as teaching fellows for data-intensive courses, and served to kindle the desire to help fill the gap in how we talk about and understand data. Learning about the Online Education Innovation (OEI) grant, Stefan and Robert decided it was time to kickstart a collaboration to begin version 1 of teaching data fluency.

The mission of this project is to build and deploy a web-based application as a data analysis lab that can be incorporated into existing classes as an online module, or act as a stand-alone tutorial for biologists to learn basic data interpretation, analysis, and visualization skills, providing generalizable concepts applicable to other programming languages or in collaborating with informatics personnel.

Our project goals are as follows:
* To engage in active discussion with biologists to better understand the challenges they face working with data
* To build and deploy an interactive web application to teach the principles of data fluency

We hope to gain further insight from the community and engage in discussing how we might iterate on the current version of this project. In the meantime, we hope you enjoy the initial product of our work for the OEI project.

You might have noticed that "Big" is crossed out in the title and thought to yourself *why would they use a strikethrough in the title?*.  The reason is that this was the title of our original proposal but as the project developed we realized that the best way to actually meet our goals in an introductory tutorial was to use a relatively small dataset.
