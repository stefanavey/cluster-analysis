## About the Authors
Stefan Avey is a 3rd year graduate student in the Interdepartmental PhD Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics where he studies the immune response to influenza infection and vaccination. Stefan began his training in Bioinformatics as an undergraduate at Florida State University and aspires to go on to teach at the college level post-graduation. He recently served as a teaching fellow for Yale's  introductory biology modules BIOL 103/104. When not in front of the computer Stefan enjoys camping, ultimate frisbee, and above all spending time with his wife.

Robert Amezquita is a 3rd year graduate student in the Department of Immunobiology, studying how immunological memory forms in response to infectious disease and vaccination. Serving as a Teaching Fellow for the Introduction to Immunobiology and Genomics Methods courses in the 2013-2014 academic year, Robert is intimately familiar with the challenges of introducing “big data” concepts to non-computational audiences, particularly in the realm of biology. Robert hails from the Department of Bioengineering at the University of California, San Diego. He is a proud father to two adorable “Pomimo” puppies, a part-time sous chef with his new fiance, and loves technology, football, and the great outdoors.
